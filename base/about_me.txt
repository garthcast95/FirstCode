My name is Brennan Garth Castillo
I'm an Applied Computer Science and been aiming to graduate on Spring 2021. I went to law school in the Philippines for a year but decided to explore other endeavours outside the country. 
Computer Science is a growing field and has been one of the biggest trends in the industry. I have little to none experience in Computing but really enjoy manipulating data. So I think Computer Science would help me create and manage data on my own.
